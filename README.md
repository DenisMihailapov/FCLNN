# FCLNN

Fully Connected Layers Neural Network

The aim of the project is to facilitate the understanding of the work and, in particular, the training of basic neural networks. 
The code is organized in the best practices of modern machine learning frameworks (torch, tensorflow). 

The project is constantly being developed and rethought. 
We plan to create a mini framework with documentation.
